## Abstract

The comparative morphological study using scanning electron microscopy of the ganoine of scales of Semionotidae, Lepisosteidae, and Polypteridae reveals tubercles located on their surface. These tubercles appear to have specific characteristics and can be used for the recognition of different fossil taxa.

**PALEONTOLOGY** — The use of the microscopical ornamentation of the ganoine in the taxonomical determination of isolated scales.

*The morphological comparative study of the ganoine of the scales in Semionotidae, Lepisosteidae and Polypteridae with scanning electron microscope exhibits tubercles located on its surface. These tubercles seem to be specifical characters and can be used to determine the different fossil taxa.*

## Introduction

Ganoid scales are generally very well preserved regardless of the nature and age of the sediment in which they are found. They often represent the only fossilized element of the fish, especially when it has undergone post-mortem displacement.

However, with the exception of form and/or surface ornamentation, it was often very difficult to attribute isolated scales to a determined genus and sometimes even to a family.

This gap being noted, and having observed the presence of tubercles on the ganoine surface of numerous dermoskeletal elements, we undertook, within the framework of a Thematic Programmed Action funded by C.N.R.S., and in parallel with research on the origin of this ganoine, a comparative structural study of ganoid scales of extant and fossil fish with the goal of discovering a taxonomic definition for these scales.

## Materials and Methods

The external ganoine surface of scales from:
- **17 species of Lepisosteidae** (extant and fossil)
- **3 species of Polypteridae**
- **4 species of Semionotidae**
- **2 Palaeonisciformes**

was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The number of individuals and scales observed varied from 1 to 3 according to species studied.

## Study of the External Ganoine Surface by SEM

### A. General Observations

**(1)** The external ganoine surface of all scales observed, both extant and fossil, presents a series of small rounded reliefs or tubercles, more or less regularly arranged. These tubercles had already been noted by Schultze in a Semionotiform (*Dapedius* sp.) and by Ermin et al. in *Polypterus endlicheri*.

**(2)** These tubercles are always present on the ganoine, whether it is pluristratified as on scales, or unistratified (*ibid.*) as on dermal bones, pinnules, or lepidotrichia. They have been observed on the ganoine of gular plates and pinnules of *Polypterus bichir* and on the ganoine of skull bones and lepidotrichia of a *Lepisosteus* (*Lepisosteus* sp.).

**(3)** For a given scale, the diameter of these tubercles is essentially constant.

**(4)** For a given individual, the diameter and density of these tubercles are constant, regardless of the position of the scale on the body (flank scales, back scales, caudal scales) and independent of whether or not it belongs to the lateral line.

**(5)** For a given species, the diameter and density of tubercles do not vary according to the age of the animal [observations made on two *Polypterus bichir* of 120 mm and 160 mm (fig. 2)].

Furthermore, observation of a regenerated scale of *Calamoichthys calabaricus* showed that this tubercular configuration was indeed characteristic of the species, since the tubercles of the regenerated parts are perfectly identical to those of the original scale.

**(6)** The base diameter of these tubercles varies for the observed species between the following maximum values: 2.75 μm in a Paramblypteridae to 9.07 μm in *Atractosteus strausi*. Their measured height in *Lepisosteus platostomus* is only 0.4 μm for a diameter of 4 μm in this species; these tubercles are therefore relatively flat, "button-like."

---

### B. Role of These Tubercles

According to Meunier et al., these tubercles could have a **mechanical function**. Indeed, on scales, the ganoine is covered by the epidermis. However, contrary to what is known for elasmoid scales, where attachment fibers connect the superficial layer of the scale to the dermo-epidermal region, no fibrous structure allowing reciprocal attachment of the ganoine and the basal layer of the epidermis has been observed on ganoid scales.

On the other hand, there exists, in place of the basal membrane, a particularly well-structured organic layer, the "**intermediate layer**," which ensures a true junction between the epidermis and the ganoine. The "tubercles-intermediate layer" ensemble could thus ensure the role of an "**anti-slip structure**" minimizing the sliding of the epidermis on the ganoine during water flow over the integument during fish swimming.

---

### C. Description and Comparison of Ganoine Surfaces of Scales — Results Obtained

Comparison of base diameters of tubercles and spaces separating them allows the separation of different taxa, whether extant and fossil, not only between different families (Semionotidae and Lepisosteidae), which was not always previously possible, but also within the same family (Lepisosteidae).

Thus, Semionotidae (fig. 1) are separated from Lepisosteidae by the spaces between tubercles, which are very irregular.

Within Lepisosteidae, *Lepisosteus* (fig. 3) is separated from *Atractosteus* (fig. 4) by the presence of smaller tubercles (base diameter) and larger spaces generally separating them.

Comparison of tubercular surfaces of scales of undetermined fossil Lepisosteidae (fig. 5, 6) with those of the sample type defined by extant forms (fig. 3, 4) and named fossil forms (by osteological and meristic characters), now allows definition of at least the genus to which these scales belong and even, in certain cases, the species.

The naming of known fossil scales or the change of naming of certain allows us to review on more complete and more accurate bases the paleobiogeography of certain families such as Lepisosteidae or Semionotidae (work in progress).

## Significance

This short paper established a **revolutionary method** for identifying isolated ganoid scales that was previously impossible. The key findings:

1. **Tubercle characteristics are species-specific** and constant across:
   - Different body positions
   - Different ages
   - Regenerated vs. original scales

2. **SEM observation is non-destructive** and provides rapid taxonomic identification

3. **The method enables paleobiogeographic studies** that were previously impossible with fragmentary material

4. **Families and genera can be distinguished** even from single isolated scales
